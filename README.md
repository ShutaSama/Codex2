# Codex2

Codex2 is a simple command-line quiz application. It now uses the
[Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library to provide colored output
and a nicer interface.

## Usage
First install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install rich
```

Then run `python quiz.py` to start the quiz.

## Future Plans
- Add more questions
- Support for saving high scores
