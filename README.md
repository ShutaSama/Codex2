# Codex2

Codex2 is a feature-rich command-line quiz application written in Python.

## Usage
Run `python quiz.py` to start the quiz with default questions.

Options:
- `-f, --file PATH` &mdash; specify a custom JSON file with questions
- `-n, --num N` &mdash; ask only the first `N` randomly selected questions
- `--show-scores` &mdash; display previously saved high scores and exit

After finishing a quiz, you can enter your name to save the result in
`highscores.json`.

## Future Plans
- Add categories and timed quizzes
- Improve question management through a GUI
